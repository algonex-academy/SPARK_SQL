Predefined Databases in MySQL

Predefined Databases are system-level databases automatically created by MySQL during installation
to manage internal operations, security, performance, and metadata

-> These databases are not for business data
-> They are for MySQL engine operations

Think of them as the operating system of MySQL

Why MySQL Needs Predefined Databases?
To manage:
- Users & permissions
- Server performance
- Metadata
- Recovery
- Storage engines
- Query optimization

Without them -> MySQL cannot function

List of Predefined Databases 
 Database           | Purpose                             
 mysql              | User & privilege management         
 information_schema | Metadata of all databases           
 performance_schema | Performance monitoring              
 sys                | Performance analytics (friendly UI)  Don't worry inkaa detailga will see

1. mysql Database —> Security Brain of MySQL
Stores all user accounts, passwords, roles, and privileges

What It Contains:
- User login info
-Access permissions
- Role assignments
- Password encryption

Example Tables:
user
db
tables_priv
columns_priv
This database controls who can access what

Mem Companylo Usage:

Create users
Grant privileges
Control security
Role-based access
Every production system heavily depends on this database

2. information_schema —> Metadata Database
Contains structural information about all databases, tables, columns, indexes, constraints, and views
Simplega Database of Databases

What You Can Query:
- List all tables
- View column details
- Find indexes
- Check constraints
- Inspect schema design

SELECT * 
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'mydb';
-> Company teams use this to analyze schema dynamically

3. performance_schema —> Performance Monitoring Engine
Collects real-time performance metrics of MySQL server

Tracks:
- Query execution time
- Resource usage
- Thread activity
- Locking
- I/O operations

Companylo Usage Chudunndi:
Detect slow queries
Optimize performance
Debug bottlenecks
System tuning
Used by DBAs & senior backend engineers

4. sys Database —> Performance Analytics Layer
A user-friendly wrapper built on top of performance_schema

Simplifies complex performance data into easy-to-read views

Example Use:
- Top slow queries
- Heavy CPU usage queries
- Table access frequency
Think of sys as performance dashboard for MySQL

 Role              | Database Used                    
 Backend Developer | information_schema              
 Data Engineer     | information_schema + sys         
 DBA               | mysql + performance_schema + sys 
 Security Engineer | mysql                            

mysql -> Security Brain
information_schema -> Metadata Brain
performance_schema -> Performance Brain
sys -> Performance Dashboard
