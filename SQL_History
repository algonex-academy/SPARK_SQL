1970 — Dr. Edgar F. Codd (IBM Scientist)

He introduced the Relational Model in his research paper: A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks

Data should be stored in tables (relations)
Rows → Tuples
Columns → Attributes
Relationships → Keys

This paper revolutionized database theory and created the foundation for modern databases & SQL

IBM Research Lab (San Jose, California)
1973 – 1979
IBM started a project named System R to implement Codd’s relational model.

Two IBM Engineers:
Donald D. Chamberlin
Raymond F. Boyce

SEQUEL was already trademarked → IBM shortened it to SQL

They developed a language called:
SEQUEL → Structured English Query Language

Later renamed to:
SQL – Structured Query Language

Rise of Major SQL Databases (Industry Adoption eppudindi)

| Year | Database             |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| 1979 | Oracle               |
| 1983 | IBM DB2              |
| 1985 | Informix             |
| 1989 | Sybase               |
| 1995 | MySQL                |
| 1996 | PostgreSQL           |
| 2000 | Microsoft SQL Server |

2010 – Present
With Big Data + AI + Cloud + IoT, new database needs arose → NoSQL

SQL powers enti:
- Banking systems
- UPI transactions
- E-commerce orders
- Swiggy/Zomato delivery tracking
- Amazon orders
- Netflix recommendation analytics
- Instagram user data

SQL is evolving into FUTURE:
- Cloud-native SQL
- Distributed SQL
- AI + SQL integrations
Real-time analytics engines

Example:
-Google BigQuery
- Snowflake
- Amazon Redshift
- Azure Synapse
