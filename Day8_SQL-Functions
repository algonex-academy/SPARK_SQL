 CONCAT()             | Join text            | Show full name in UI/DB | SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) FROM users;         
 LOWER()/ UPPER()    | Change case            | Case-insensitive login  | SELECT LOWER(email) FROM users;        
 TRIM()              | Remove spaces          | Clean user input        | SELECT TRIM(name) FROM users;                                 
 SUBSTRING()         | Get part of text       | Mask phone numbers      | SELECT SUBSTRING(phone,1,4) FROM users;                       
 REPLACE()           | Replace text           | Bulk email/domain fix   | SELECT REPLACE(email,'@gmail.com','@company.com') FROM users; 
 INSTR()             | Find position          | Validate email format   | SELECT INSTR(email,'@') FROM users;                           

CONCAT() -> Joins multiple text fields into one
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM users;
-> Show full names in dashboards, invoices, admin panels(Normalga nuvveppudina job applicationlo fill chesthuntaav kadaa)

LOWER() / UPPER() - Converts text case (Case-insensitive login, email normalization, search)
SELECT LOWER(email) FROM users;

TRIM() - Removes extra spaces(Clean form inputs before storing/searching)
UPDATE users SET name = TRIM(name);

Imp: SUBSTRING()- Extracts part of text (Masking phone/email in UI)
SELECT CONCAT(SUBSTRING(phone,1,2), '******', SUBSTRING(phone,-2)) AS masked FROM users;

REPLACE() - Replaces text patterns(Bulk data cleanup, migrations)
UPDATE users SET email = REPLACE(email, '@gmail.com', '@company.com');

INSTR() - Finds position of substring (Validate email format in quick audits)
SELECT email FROM users WHERE INSTR(email,'@') = 0;

INSTR(string, substring)
It returns the position (index) of a substring inside a string
If found -> returns position (starts from 1)
If not found -> returns 0
Ex: INSTR('hello@gmail.com', '@');   -- Output: 6
INSTR('hellogmail.com', '@');    -- Output: 0

Ex: Some locality names might contain extra commas or wrong symbols
SELECT property_id, locality
FROM properties
WHERE INSTR(locality, ',') > 0;

CEIL() / FLOOR() -- Round up/down
SELECT CEIL(total_amount) FROM orders;

MOD() - Remainder
SELECT MOD(user_id, 4) AS shard FROM users;

Use aggregates for KPIs
Use CASE for segmentation
Use DATEDIFF/TIMESTAMPDIFF for churn & trials
Use IFNULL to avoid null-related UI bugs

Dataset columns (from Dataset):
property_id, type, activation_date, bathroom, floor, total_floor,
furnishing, gym, latitude, longitude, lease_type, lift, locality, parking, property_age, property_size,
swimming_pool, pin_code, rent, deposit, building_type

Filtering (WHERE)
- Find all 2 BHK properties
SELECT * FROM properties WHERE type = 'BHK2';
- Properties with rent under 20k
SELECT property_id, locality, rent 
FROM properties 
WHERE rent < 20000;
- Furnished flats with gym
SELECT property_id, furnishing, gym 
FROM properties 
WHERE furnishing = 'FULLY_FURNISHED' AND gym = 1;
- Search by locality (LIKE)
SELECT * FROM properties WHERE locality LIKE '%Brookefield%';

String Functions
- Show display title for cards
SELECT CONCAT(type, ' in ', locality) AS display_title FROM properties;
- Normalize furnishing text
SELECT UPPER(furnishing) FROM properties;

Numeric Functions
- Round rent for reports
SELECT property_id, ROUND(rent, 0) FROM properties;
- Monthly EMI estimate
SELECT property_id, CEIL(deposit / 12) AS approx_monthly_deposit FROM properties;

Date Functions
- Recently activated (last 30 days)
SELECT property_id, activation_date
FROM properties
WHERE activation_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
- Days since activation
SELECT property_id, DATEDIFF(NOW(), activation_date) AS days_live
FROM properties;

Aggregate Functions
- Average rent by locality
SELECT locality, AVG(rent) AS avg_rent
FROM properties
GROUP BY locality;
- Count of properties per BHK type
SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS total_listings
FROM properties
GROUP BY type;
- Highest rent property
SELECT MAX(rent) AS max_rent FROM properties;

Conditional Logic
- Label property as Budget / Premium
SELECT property_id,
CASE 
  WHEN rent < 15000 THEN 'Budget'
  WHEN rent BETWEEN 15000 AND 30000 THEN 'Mid-Range'
  ELSE 'Premium'
END AS price_segment
FROM properties;
- Handle NULL safely
SELECT property_id, IFNULL(parking, 'NOT_SPECIFIED') FROM properties;

Updates & Deletes
UPDATE properties 
SET rent = rent - 1000 
WHERE property_id = 'ff80808147ed5e68014810c42dba0ff0';
- Remove wrong listing
DELETE FROM properties 
WHERE property_id = 'some_wrong_id';

Transactions (TCL)
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE properties SET rent = rent * 1.05 WHERE locality = 'Brookefield';
-- If mistake:
ROLLBACK;
-- If correct:
COMMIT;

SPARK Try this:
Top 5 expensive properties
Properties with gym + pool
Average rent by BHK type in each locality
List all BHK2 under ₹20,000 with lift
Find top 3 localities with highest average rent
Mark properties older than 5 years as “Old Stock” using CASE
