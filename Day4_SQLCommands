Databases without data are useless, Data without queries is powerless -> SQL gives power

 Component                Role                         
 MySQL Server    | Stores & processes data      
 MySQL Workbench | Tool to interact with server 
-> If noo Workbench -> You can’t talk to MySQL amigo's

Realtime Example: Online Shopping App
Business/Industty Concepts:
Customers
Products
Orders
Payments

SQL Concepts:
Tables
Columns
Rows
Relationships
-> Remember this mapping is the soul of SQL

As a Professional will follow this SPARK:
SELECT database
-> Check table structure
-> Insert clean data
-> Query with purpose
Don;t do random querying have the purpose when writing the query

Create a new Connection/Server-> DB/Schema ->table:
Algonex -> Connection/Server
SPARK -> DB
products - > Table
Columns:
product_id
product_name
category
price
stock

Tasks:
- insert 5 products
- Write 5 SELECT queries using WHERE

SQL Commands? Observe : SQL commands are instructions you give to the database engine to manage, store, control, and analyze data
Not all commands do the same job (Show fig. there about commands & dtypes)

Just like in Algonex company:
- Some people build infrastructure
- Some work with data
- Some control access
- Some manage transactions
SQL commands are also divided this way

SQL commands are divided into 5 categories:
DDL  -> Structure
DML  -> Data
DQL  -> Questions
DCL  -> Security
TCL  -> Transactions
If a fresher understands this flow clearly -> they are already above average

DDL — Data Definition Language ->(Database Architecture Layer)
DDL commands define the structure of the database like Building the Algonex office, not working yet inside it

DDL Commands:
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
TRUNCATE
RENAME

1. CREATE - Creating Business Reality
SPARK Examples:
- Create a database for a company
- Create a table for employees
Create a table for orders

CREATE DATABASE company_db;
USE company_db;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

DDL commands change metadata (means it will do changes on permanent/main data), not just data

2. ALTER - Business Change Management
modifying an existing business structure

Real-world examples:
- Company adds a new column -> email
- Company changes salary format
- Company renames a column

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);

3. DROP - Permanent Destruction
This command Completely removes the structure + data
DROP TABLE employees;

Senior-level warning(It not flowed you'll get fired):
- DROP has NO undo
- Rarely used in production
- Mostly used in development/testing

4. TRUNCATE - Resetting Data (Fast & Dangerous)
It deletes all rows, keeps structure
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

Difference from DELETE: (SPARK Ask yourself) 
- Faster
- Cannot rollback
- No WHERE condition

Used when:
- Resetting test data
- Cleaning staging environments
