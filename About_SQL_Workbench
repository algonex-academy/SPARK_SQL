MySQL Workbench?: MySQL Workbench is a professional visual tool used by developers, data engineers, analysts, and DBAs to design, develop, test, optimize, and manage MySQL databases
Inkaa Simplega MySQL Workbench = Control Center of MySQL Databases

Why Companies Use MySQL Workbench(SPARK Cheptharu)

 Feature             Industry Benefit          
 SQL Editor        | Write & execute queries,Debug, Optimize   
 Schema Designer   | Design databases visually
 ER Diagram        | Visualize relationships, Create table relationships, Build chemas 
 Server Monitoring | Check performance( Manage users, Monitor performance, Backup databases, Restore databases),Configure server settings         
 User Management   | Control access            
 Backup & Restore  | Data protection           
Without Workbench -> Managing databases becomes slow and risky

MySQL Workbench Interface
 Panel               Purpose                        

 Navigator      | Shows databases, tables, views

 Output Panel   | Shows execution logs           
 Administration | Server & user management       

Endukuee SQL Nechukovaali because:
- 95% of companies use GUI-based DB tools
Interviewers expect:
- Schema design skills
- Query execution confidence
Performance awareness

Knowing only SQL syntax ≠ Job-ready
Knowing Workbench = Industry-ready

SPARK IMP: ER Diagram = Entity Relationship Diagram
Used to:
- Plan database
- Avoid design mistakes
- Build scalable systems

Customers -> Orders -> Payments
Have this idea: Companies never build databases without ER diagrams

Backend Developer:
- Table design
-Stored procedures
- Query optimization

Data Analyst:
- Writing analytical queries
- Exporting reports
- Data validation

DBA(Data base Administartor):
- Performance tuning
- Backup & recovery
- Security management

MySQL Workbench is an integrated visual development tool that allows database developers, analysts, and administrators to design schemas,
write and optimize SQL queries, manage server configurations, monitor performance, and perform backup and recovery 
all from a single professional interface

Final Process: Basic UI -> SQL Editor -> Data Modeling -> Performance Tuning -> DBA Basics
