MySQL Workbench?: MySQL Workbench is a professional visual tool used by developers, data engineers, analysts, and DBAs to design, develop, test, optimize, and manage MySQL databases
Inkaa Simplega MySQL Workbench = Control Center of MySQL Databases

Why Companies Use MySQL Workbench(SPARK Cheptharu)

 Feature             Industry Benefit          
 SQL Editor        | Write & execute queries,Debug, Optimize   
 Schema Designer   | Design databases visually
 ER Diagram        | Visualize relationships, Create table relationships, Build chemas 
 Server Monitoring | Check performance( Manage users, Monitor performance, Backup databases, Restore databases),Configure server settings         
 User Management   | Control access            
 Backup & Restore  | Data protection           
Without Workbench -> Managing databases becomes slow and risky

Our Company Workflow Using Workbench chudandi 

Business Requirement

Deployment        -> All this happens inside MySQL Workbench

MySQL Workbench Interface
 Panel               Purpose                        

 Navigator      | Shows databases, tables, views 
 SQL Editor     | Write queries                  
 Result Grid    | Displays output                
 Output Panel   | Shows execution logs           
 Administration | Server & user management       

Endukuee SQL Nechukovaali because:
- 95% of companies use GUI-based DB tools
Interviewers expect:
- Schema design skills
- Query execution confidence
Performance awareness

Knowing only SQL syntax ≠ Job-ready
Knowing Workbench = Industry-ready

SPARK IMP: ER Diagram = Entity Relationship Diagram
Used to:
- Plan database
- Avoid design mistakes
- Build scalable systems

Customers -> Orders -> Payments
Have this idea: Companies never build databases without ER diagrams

Schema Design Flow Using Workbench
Identify Entities
        |
Create Tables
        |
Assign Primary Keys
        |
Define Relationships
        |
Generate SQL Script
        |
Deploy Database

Backend Developer:
- Table design
-Stored procedures
- Query optimization

Data Analyst:
- Writing analytical queries
- Exporting reports
- Data validation

DBA(Data base Administartor):
- Performance tuning
- Backup & recovery
- Security management

MySQL Workbench is an integrated visual development tool that allows database developers, analysts, and administrators to design schemas,
write and optimize SQL queries, manage server configurations, monitor performance, and perform backup and recovery 
all from a single professional interface

Final Process: Basic UI -> SQL Editor -> Data Modeling -> Performance Tuning -> DBA Basics

By the end of this session, a SPARK should be able to:
- Open MySQL Workbench confidently
-  Connect to MySQL Server
-  Create a database (schema)
- Create tables like an industry engineer
- Understand where system databases end and business databases start

Today understand environment-> no need theory

When you open MySQL Workbench focus ONLY on these:
1. Home Screen
- MySQL Connections
- Server status
- User sessions
This is where real work starts

2. SQL Editor (SPARK Imp. Area) -> This is your battlefield hahaa
You’ll use it to:
- Write SQL
- Execute queries
- Debug errors
- Test logic
We like engineers spend 90% of their our here

3. Navigator Panel (Left Side)
Shows:
- System databases
- Your business databases
- Tables, views, procedures
This tells you what data exists -> not how to query it

3/ Connecting to MySQL Server (Reality Step)
Typical Setup:
- Host: localhost
- Port: 3306
- Username: root
- Password: (set during installation)
If you can’t connect -> you can’t work -> you can’t be hired (Don't worry you're SPARK)

NEVER use system databases for practice
System DBs:
- mysql
- information_schema
- performance_schema
- sys

ALWAYS create your own business database, this is how professionalga companylo work chestham

CARETE DB: CREATE DATABASE company_db;
THEN: USE company_db;
EXAMPLE: CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KeY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    joining_date DATE
);

Explain Like an SQL Developer from SPARK:
employee_id -> identity
VARCHAR -> flexible real-world text
DECIMAL -> money precision
DATE -> business timelines
This is not just syntax — this is business modeling in IT aas SQL Developer

SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE employees;
If this works -> your setup is perfectly working amigos

Open Workbench
    |
Connect Server
    |
Select Business DB
    |
Create Tables
    |
Insert Data
    |
Query Data
    |
Optimize

Today you built the container kadaa like all the Workbench fucntionality checks 

BUT tomorrow you control the data in the Workbench through INSERT, SELECT, WHERE.....
