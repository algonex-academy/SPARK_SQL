Databases without data are useless, Data without queries is powerless -> SQL gives power through queries 

 Component                Role                         
 MySQL Server    | Stores & processes data      
 MySQL Workbench | Tool to interact with server 
-> If noo Workbench -> You can’t talk to MySQL stored Data amigo's

Realtime Example: Online Shopping App
Business/Industty Concepts:
Customers
Products
Orders
Payments

SQL Concepts:
Tables
Columns
Rows
Relationships
-> Remember this mapping is the soul of SQL

As a Professional will follow this SPARK:
SELECT database
-> Check table structure
-> Insert clean data
-> Query with purpose
Don't do random querying have the purpose when writing the query

Create a new Connection/Server-> DB/Schema ->table:
Algonex -> Connection/Server
SPARK -> DB   create database SPARK;
products - > Table
Columns:
product_id
product_name
category
price
stock

Tasks:
- insert 5 products
- Write 5 SELECT queries using WHERE

SQL Commands? Observe : SQL commands are instructions you give to the database engine to manage,
store, control, and analyze data
Ex: These instrcutions/Commands having a special meaning inside SQL Workbench to make the communication with DB's 
like Spanish people don't understand Telugu and vice versa 
Not all commands do the same job (Show fig. there about commands & dtypes)

Just like in Algonex company:
- Some people build infrastructure
- Some work with data
- Some control/monitoring access
- Some manage transactions
SQL commands are also divided this way

SQL commands are divided into 5 categories:
DDL  -> Structure
DML  -> Data
DQL  -> Questions
DCL  -> Security
TCL  -> Transactions
If a fresher understands this flow clearly -> they are already above average

1. DDL — Data Definition Language ->(Database Architecture/Structure Layer)
DDL commands define the structure of the database like Building the Algonex office, not working yet inside it
-> Just like Constructed building without any furniture inside

DDL Commands:
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
TRUNCATE
RENAME

1. CREATE - Creating Business/Data Real entity
SPARK Examples:
- Create a database for a company
- Create a table for employees and orders

CREATE DATABASE database_name;
 [Ex: CREATE DATABASE company_db; ]
USE company_db;

-- Creating table inside current  DB
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype [constraints],
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);

Ex: CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    Salary Decimal(60,30)
);    

DDL commands change metadata/Main data (means it will do changes on permanent/main data), not just data

2. ALTER - Business Change Management
modifying an existing business structure

Real-world examples:
- Company adds a new column -> email
- Company changes salary format
- Company renames a column

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;

3. DROP - Permanent Destruction
This command Completely removes the structure + data
DROP TABLE employees;

Senior-level warning(It not flowed you'll get fired):
- DROP has NO undo
- Rarely used in production
- Mostly used in development/testing

4. TRUNCATE - Resetting Data (Fast & Dangerous)
It deletes all rows, keeps structure
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

Difference from DELETE: (SPARK Ask yourself) 
- Faster
- Cannot rollback
- No WHERE condition

Used when:
- Resetting test data
- Cleaning staging environments

2. DML - Data Manipulation Language (Business Activity Layer)-> Ikkadee manupulations anni hapen avuthaay
DML commands work with actual business data to make modifications
Examples: Employees joining, orders happening, payments processing

DML Commands:
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE

1.INSERT -> business Events(Modification/new records) coming into DB
Examples:
- New user signup
- New order placed
- New employee joined
/
type1: INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
Type2: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);


INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department)
VALUES (1039871, 'Harshitha', 'IT');
-> This INSERT represents real-time events- not just data entry

2. UPDATE- Business Corrections
Fixing or changing business data
Examples chudandi:
- Salary hike
- Department change
- Profile update

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1
WHERE condition;


Ex: UPDATE employees
SET department = 'Finance'
WHERE employee_id = 101;

3. DELETE - Business Removal
-> Removing business records logically

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Ex: DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 101;

How difference from TRUNCATE:
- DELETE is row-level
- DELETE can use WHERE
- DELETE can be rolled back (with transactions)

4. DQL - Data Query Language (IDi decision-Making Layer)
DQL is where SQL becomes valuable like asking questions to data
Only one command SELECT-> ut don’t underestimate it

Examples:
- Who are our top employees?
- What are today’s sales?
- Which product is failing?

SELECT * FROM table_name;
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

ex: SELECT name, department
FROM employees;
-> We’ll go extremely deep into SELECT later on(filters, joins, analytics)

DROP DATABASE database_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;
