Databases without data are useless, Data without queries is powerless -> SQL gives power through queries 

 Component                Role                         
 MySQL Server    | Stores & processes data      
 MySQL Workbench | Tool to interact with server 
-> If noo Workbench -> You can’t talk to MySQL stored Data amigo's

Realtime Example: Online Shopping App
Business/Industty Concepts:
Customers
Products
Orders
Payments

SQL Concepts:
Tables
Columns
Rows
Relationships
-> Remember this mapping is the soul of SQL

As a Professional will follow this SPARK:
SELECT database
-> Check table structure
-> Insert clean data
-> Query with purpose
Don't do random querying have the purpose when writing the query

Create a new Connection/Server-> DB/Schema ->table:
Algonex -> Connection/Server
SPARK -> DB   create database SPARK;
products - > Table
Columns:
product_id
product_name
category
price
stock

Tasks:
- insert 5 products
- Write 5 SELECT queries using WHERE

SQL Commands? Observe : SQL commands are instructions you give to the database engine to manage,
store, control, and analyze data
Ex: These instrcutions/Commands having a special meaning inside SQL Workbench to make the communication with DB's 
like Spanish people don't understand Telugu and vice versa 
Not all commands do the same job (Show fig. there about commands & dtypes)

Just like in Algonex company:
- Some people build infrastructure
- Some work with data
- Some control/monitoring access
- Some manage transactions
SQL commands are also divided this way

SQL commands are divided into 5 categories:
DDL  -> Structure
DML  -> Data Change
DQL  -> Questions/Data Fetch
DCL  -> Security/Permissions
TCL  -> Transactions
If a fresher understands this flow clearly -> they are already above average

1. DDL — Data Definition Language ->(Database Architecture/Structure Layer)
DDL commands define the structure of the database like Building the Algonex office, not working yet inside it
-> Just like Constructed building without any furniture inside

DDL Commands:
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
TRUNCATE
RENAME

1. CREATE - Creating Business/Data Real entity
SPARK Examples:
- Create a database for a company
- Create a table for employees and orders
- Creating new modules (Users, Orders, Payments)
- Spinning up new services (microservices DB)
- Setting up staging / prod schemas

CREATE DATABASE database_name;
 [Ex: CREATE DATABASE company_db; ]
USE company_db;

-- Creating table inside current  DB
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype [constraints],
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);

Ex: CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    Salary Decimal(60,30)
);    
Ex:2 
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Note: Always design with:
- Primary keys
- Indexes
- Constraints
Otherwise performance + data quality breaks in main production kadaa

DDL commands change metadata/Main data (means it will do changes on permanent/main data), not just data

2. ALTER - Business Change Management/Schema Evolution Without Breaking Production
modifying an existing main business(Tables,Colums)  structure

Real-world examples:
- Company adds a new column -> email, Contact
- Company changes salary format
- Company renames a column (Employee_ID -> emp_id)
- New feature requires a new column
- Renaming columns
- Changing datatype after feedback

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);

ALTER TABLE users ADD phone VARCHAR(15);

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;

3. DROP - Permanent Destruction
This command Completely removes the structure + data from thre Database
But it can be ROLLBACK, if it is stored in SAVEPOINT

DROP TABLE employees;
DROP DATABASE Database_name;

Senior-level warning(It not followed you'll get fired):
- DROP has NO undo(But Only in-case of stored data in Savepoint) 
- Rarely used in production/final modifications
- Mostly used in development/testing

4. TRUNCATE - Resetting Data (Fast & Dangerous)
It deletes all rows, keeps structure(Tables with Colums inside Database)

TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

Difference from DELETE: (SPARK Ask yourself) 
- Faster
- Cannot rollback
- No WHERE condition

Used when:
- Resetting test/Sample data
- Cleaning staging environments
- Reset mobile loosing all contacts but keeping the s/w apps

2. DML - Data Manipulation Language (Business Modifications Activity Layer)-> Ikkadee manupulations anni hapen avuthaay
DML commands work with actual business data to make modifications to the tables
Examples: Employees joining, orders happening, payments processing or any sort of modications/Processes 

DML Commands:
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE

1.INSERT -> New business Events(Modification/new records) coming into DB
Examples:
- New user signup into Algonex
- New order placed from Flipkart
- New employee joined

type1(Without mention Columns): INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
Note: Don't use Type1 because column order changes will break your app

Type2: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);


INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department)
VALUES (1039871, 'Harshitha', 'IT');

INSERT INTO users (full_name, email)
VALUES ('Sainath Namala', 'sainath@gmail.com');

-> This INSERT represents real-time events- not just data entry

2. UPDATE- Business Data Corrections
It is for fixing or changing business data
Examples chudandi:
- Salary hike (10k -> 90% hikes gives 19k)
- Department change (Developer -> Testing)
- Profile update (Changes in Photo, details,..)

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1
WHERE condition; -- Which updates Column value/values on following condition 

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1; -- This updates the entire column with value1

Ex: UPDATE employees
SET department = 'Finance'
WHERE employee_id = 101;

3. DELETE - Business data Removal 
-> Removing business records logically based on the condition

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Ex: DELETE FROM Spark
WHERE spark_id = 101;

How difference from TRUNCATE:
- DELETE is row-level
- DELETE can use WHERE
- DELETE can be rolled back (with transactions)

4. DQL - Data Query Language (IDi decision-Making/output Layer)
DQL is where SQL becomes valuable like asking questions to data
Only one command SELECT-> but don’t underestimate it will get the output data using SELECT only

Examples:
- Who are our top employees?
- What are today’s sales?
- Which product is failing?

SELECT * FROM table_name; -- * represents all columns
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

ex: SELECT name, department
FROM employees;

SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column
LIMIT n OFFSET m;

SELECT user_id, full_name, email
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

Note: Algonex never use SELECT * in production APIs
-> It breaks performance + contracts (Soo mention column names instead)

-> We’ll go extremely deep into SELECT later on(filters, joins, analytics)

DROP DATABASE database_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;

4. DCL (Data Control Language)
- Who can access what? Who can do what?
-> This is database security + access control in Algonex Company Server/DB 

Manam Companies lo ela vaduthaam:
- Giving read-only access to analysts
- giving write access to backend services
- Blocking dangerous permissions in prod
- Creating separate roles for Dev, QA, Prod
- Compliance (SOC2, ISO, audits)

1. GRANT — Giving Controlled Access
Really where you'll have:
- Backend service (needs read/write)
- Analyst (read-only)
- Intern (very limited) all access based on privilege in company

GRANT privileges
ON database.table
TO 'user'@'host';

Oka example chuudu: 1.give read only access to analyst
GRANT SELECT
ON ecommerce_db.*
TO 'analyst'@'%';

2.Give full CRUD to backend service
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON ecommerce_db.*
TO 'backend_service'@'%';

3. Give permission to run procedures
GRANT EXECUTE
ON PROCEDURE ecommerce_db.process_order
TO 'api_user'@'%';

Note: - never give ALL PRIVILEGES in production
-> Grant only what is required (Principle of Least Privilege)
-> Use separate users for:
- app
- admin
- analytics

2. REVOKE — Removing Access Safely
Real scenarioslo ekkada: 
- Intern leaves
- Contractor access expired
- User misused permissions
- Security breach response

REVOKE privileges
ON database.table
FROM 'user'@'host';

Example:
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON ecommerce_db.*
FROM 'intern'@'%';

SPARK Tip: Always revoke first, then delete users,this avoids accidental downtime

SAPRK: CREATE USER
Evaristharu access:
- DB Admins
- DevOps pipelines
- Cloud provisioning scripts

CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

CREATE USER 'report_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Strong@123';
-> Never hardcode passwords in SQL scripts in production
-> Use secrets manager / environment variables

Algonexloo memelaa access istham:
 Role              Privileges                   
 Backend App | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE       
 Analyst     | SELECT                       
 Admin       | ALL PRIVILEGES (rarely used) 
 Intern      | SELECT on few tables         
 ETL Jobs    | SELECT, INSERT               
-> This separation/access avoids accidental data loss
