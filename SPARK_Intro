**Ask yourself SPARK Amigo's**

How does Amazon know what you want to buy
How does Swiggy find nearest delivery partners
How does Netflix recommend movies ?

The backbone of all this = SQL + Data

Then:
If you master SQL, you control data
If you control data- you control decisions
If you control decisions, you become valuable in any company

 Skill              -> Job Impact 
 SQL                 Mandatory  
 Python              Optional   
 Power BI / Tableau  Optional   
 Excel               Optional   

SQL is the ONLY compulsory skill in Data, Backend, Cloud, DevOps, Product & Analytics roles

Before SQL:
- Data stored in files
- Searching data = manual
- Reports = days
- Errors = high
Scaling = impossible

After SQL:
- Data stored in structured databases
- Query any data in milliseconds
- Generate reports in seconds
- Business decisions in real-time

SQL is not a language - it is a decision engine for companies

Where Exactly SQL Is Used (Let's Map to Industry)

Industry	         SQL Usage
IT Companies  	Backend systems
Banks	        Transactions, fraud detection
E-commerce	 Orders, customers, inventory
EdTech	     Students, courses, performance
Healthcare	 Patients, reports, prescriptions
Startups	       Everything

Real Roles Using SQL Daily:
- Data Analyst
- Business Analyst
- Backend Developer
- Full Stack Developer
- DevOps Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Cloud Engineer

 SQL = Universal Data Skill

How Companies Use SQL (Reality Telsukundhama)

Example Chudu: Swiggy Order System

Customers Table  
Orders Table  
Restaurants Table  
Delivery Agents Table  
Payments Table  

SQL is used to:
- Find top customers
- Detect late deliveries
- Analyze daily revenue
- Optimize delivery routing
- Detect fraud payments

SQL does not store data
SQL extracts business intelligence from raw data

Salary   Reality (India loo)
Role	                   Salary
Fresher Data Analyst	₹4 – 7 LPA
Backend SQL Developer	₹6 – 10 LPA
Business Analyst	    ₹7 – 12 LPA

SQL directly multiplies your salary potential

SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

This single query tells a company what to sell more to maximize profit
