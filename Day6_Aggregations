MySQL AGGREGATION - Saree meeku em telsoo okasaari alochinchandi
what to learn -> why -> how -> practice
It is just turning multiple rows into one meaningful answer/Insights/numbers

Example questions aggregation answers:
How many students?
Total fees collected?
Average marks?
Highest salary?
Sales per day?

Example chuudu inka clarity vasthundi:
Many orders - total revenue
Many users -> total users
Many marks -> average marks
This is how Algonex build dashboards and reports on student details

Initialga: 1. Create a Simple Practice Table
CREATE DATABASE school_db;
USE school_db;

CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    marks INT,
    class INT
);

INSERT INTO students (name, marks, class) VALUES
('Sumasree', 85, 10),
('Neha', 92, 10),
('Sumanth', 70, 10),
('Keerthi', 88, 9),
('Saiganesh', 60, 9),
('Jayakrishna', 95, 10);

Aggregations- COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX with GROUP BY and HAVING to build meanigfull reports/insights
SPARK Shortfcut: C S A M M G H (Lastlo malli matladukundham)
1. COUNT() - It counts the number of rows/records for a particular column
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name; -- COUNT(*) will count all number of rows

Example: 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students FROM students;
SELECT COUNT(Column_ame) AS total_users FROM users; -- Use when there is NULL values in column
Dinnibatti will use in:
"How many users signed up?"
"How many orders today?"
"How many employees?"

2. SUM() - What is the total means it will add numbers/row values of a particular column
SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders; -- Total revenue vasthundi by adding all amount column row values kadaa

/* Total sales
Total salary payout
Total amount collected today/This week/monthly/annual */

3. AVG() - What is the average value of all row values for column
Syntax: SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;

SELECT AVG(marks) AS average_marks
FROM students; -- Average marks
SELECT AVG(amount) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders; -- Average order value

4. MIN() and MAX() - Smallest & Biggest Values of a column from all row/record values
SELECT MIN(column_name), MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;

Example chudu: SELECT 
    MIN(marks) AS lowest_marks,
    MAX(marks) AS highest_marks
FROM students; -- Lowest, Highest Markks

SELECT MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary,
       MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees; -- Lowest, Highest Salary

/* Highest order
Lowest salary
lowest/highest purchases
First & last date */

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
  SUM(amount) AS total
  AVG(salary) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders; --  IDi cheyandi andaru

5. GROUP BY - Make groups and get one number for all common row values and then calculate along with aggregate functions
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;

Ex: -- How many students in each class(CSE/ECE/AIDS/Mech)?
SELECT class, COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students
GROUP BY class;
 -- Group students by class(CSE/ECE/AIDS/Mech)
-- Count students in each class

-- Orders per user (ANtee oka common user ennisarlu vasthee motham orders anni groupby chesthundi with aggregate functions)
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY user_id;
/* Orders per customer
Students per class
Employees per department */

Ivi chudu clarity vasthundi:
GROUP BY + SUM() — 'Total marks per class'
SELECT class, SUM/MAX/MIN/AVG(marks) AS total_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY class; -- Ilanee with other agg. functions also

select count(*) from table_name -- counts how many column rows
select count(*) from table_name
where salary =10,000; -- Gives count of rows where salary is 10k (no need of group by)

select Customer_name, count(*) from table_name
group by Customer_name; -- Groups all the common Customer names and gives how many times they repeated 

select Name, count(*) from table_name
where salary = 10,000
group by Name; -- Groups all the common Names and gives how many Names are getting 10k as salary 

6. HAVING Clause - Filter the groups after grouping of all common records for a column
-> WHERE anedi filters rows
-> HAVING filters groups

Structure chudu:   
(Ex: Users with more than 5 orders)
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5; -- Top customers, Active users, high performers

-- Show only classes with more than 3 students
SELECT class, COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNt(*) > 3;

Clause: WHERE + GROUP BY + HAVING (Together radhama)
SPARK: Count only students with marks > 70, per class
SELECT class, COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students
WHERE marks > 70
GROUP BY class;

Remember ee flow follow avuthundi:
WHERE -> filters rows first based on condition/conditions before group by
GROUP BY- makes groups of similar rows in a column/columns
HAVING -> filters groups after group by on the aggregate function result

Freshers chesee mistakes:
- Use WHERE before GROUP BY
- Don’t use WHERE with aggregate conditions
- Use HAVING for COUNT/SUM filters

SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
WHERE COUNT(*) > 5   -- idi wrong
GROUP BY user_id;

SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
