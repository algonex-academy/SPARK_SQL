Example: Give me all customers who purchased today

Ee MySQL Workbench enti?
Workbench ante Visual Tool (GUI)
Instead of typing everything in black screen, idi cheyochu:
- See tables
- Write SQL
- Run queries
- Manage users

Complete Uninstall MySQL 
SPARK Use this when:
- MySQL is already installed
- You forgot password
- MySQL is corrupted
- Setup failed earlier ilaanti casesloo...

Step 1loo: Uninstall from Control Panel (Slowga try to understand)
Go to:
Control Panel → Programs → Programs and Features

soo freshga Installation of MySQL chudham:
Step 1: Download MySQL Installer (Official site nundi)
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ (Copy chesi URL loo pettu)
                       or
Goto website and type MySQL downloads and at bottom click on MySQL community(GPL) downloads

We are installing two main things:
1️. MySQL Server
-> This is the actual database engine (stores data)
2. MySQL Workbench
-> This is a visual tool to interact with the database

Without Server -> no database kadaa
Without Workbench -> hard to use for SPARK freshers
So we install both together using the official installer

-> Download any one version SPARK ((x86, 32-bit), MSI Installer)
If asked to login -> Click 'No thanks, just start my download'

Step 3 - Start Installer
1->Double-click the downloaded .msi file
2-> Click Yes (Allow permission)

You will see "Choosing a Setup Type":
Choose: Custom/default

If custom, tap on + there until you find (*86....) green forward arrow for following :
- MySQL Server (Database Engine)
- MySQL Workbench (GUI Tool)
- MySQL Shell
- Connectors & drivers  , we even do as Algonex developer setup

Click Next
Step 4 – Check Requirements & Install Dependencies
You may see:
"Some requirements are missing'
Click: Execute
After installation: Click Next

Step 5 – MySQL Server Configuration (Most Important Step amigo's)
Now you are configuring how your database will work
Config Type: Development Computer (Idi Optimized for learning + development)

Connectivity (Port Number)
You will see: Port: 3306 (Defaultly selected kadaa)
Click Next

Authentication Method
Choose: Use Strong Password Encryption (this is used in Algonex/cubix company for security)
Click Next

Set Root Password
Enter root password: Algonex&yourDOByear (ledantee malli marchipothaav migatha studentslaa)
Write it down: Don’t forget it amigo
Root = Admin of Database kadaa
If you forget -> you must reset or reinstall

Click Next -> Execute and Finish-> Next and Finish

Step 7 - VerifY installation (Idi Login Test cheskoni okasaari install ayndha ledaa chudu)
Method 1: Using Command Prompt
Open Command Prompt: mysql -u root -p
Enter password -> If you see: Algonex@2020 (Give yours & enter into Server Connection)

Method 2: using MySQL Workbench (GUI) elaago chudu
1️. Open MySQL Workbench
2️. Click Local Instance
3️. Enter password
4️. Dashboard opens ,then GUI connection working

Step 8 – SPARK Batchloo idi try cheyandi (Confidence just Checko)
CREATE DATABASE training_db;
USE training_db;

CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  course VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO students (name, course)
VALUES ('Amit', 'SQL');

SELECT * FROM students; -- Output table vachindanukoo it is working inka cool..

Step 9 - Ee common rrors Freshers face chesthuntaary (And Fix)-> Meeku kudaa errors untee go and fix SPARK
- MySQL won't start
Ilaa fix chesko: Check service ->  Restart PC

Forgot password
Idee fix: Reset root or reinstall clean

Port 3306 already used
Idee Fix: Kill old MySQL service

Workbench not connecting
fix chesko: Start MySQL service (Setver shutdown/start option untadi chudu - Time padthundi avvadaaniki)
