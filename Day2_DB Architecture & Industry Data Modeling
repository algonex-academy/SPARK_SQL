Database Architecture & Industry Data Modelling Like a SQL Engineer, Not a Student

SQL is NOT about writing queries, it is about designing business systems
If your database design is wrong, even the best SQL query becomes useless kadaa

Today SPARK is learning how real companies design their databases

Company Data System Looks Like:
Frontend (Website / App)
        |
Backend APIs
        |
Database (SQL Engine)

Database Contains:
- Millions of users
- Billions of transactions
- Real time operations
- Zero tolerance for data loss

Today you’ll understand how to architect/build this system

What is a Database?
A Database is a digital representation of a company’s entire business

 Business              Database Represents                  
 Amazon   | Customers, orders, sellers, payments 
 Swiggy   | Users, restaurants, orders, riders   
 Bank     | Accounts, transactions, loans        
 College  | Students, attendance, marks          

No database → No business kada

What is a Table assalu (Try your answer) - Table is One real-world entity
 Real World   SQL Table 
 Student    | students  
 Product    | products  
 Order      | orders    
 Employee   | employees 

STUDENTS TABLE
id | name | email | phone | city

How we'll do in our company: First understand business → Then design tables → Then write SQL
